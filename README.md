Step 2: Customize your homepage
Great job! Now that GitHub Pages is enabled, you can view your website here: https://vvs-uranymus.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an index file. If an index file is found, GitHub Pages uses the content in the file to create the homepage. If an index file isn’t found, it uses the README.md to create the homepage.

Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.
